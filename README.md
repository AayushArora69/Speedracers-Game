# Speedracers-Game
Speedtypers is a minimalistic, typing game. Which allows users to type in your keyboard and lets you know your words per minute in an interactive-game format. The game follows the adventures of Billy & His new-found friend, His plane which unfortunately he had to rob off to run away from the people chasing him! He is surrounded by troubles, However the twist is that he cannot control the plane normally, Instead he has to type letters on the screen to navigate across the environments & those hazards!

It's a 2D-platformer. With over 6 levels of alpha-beta and some multiplayer, as who doesn't like chaos?
